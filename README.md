# Random Choice Picker

https://thedanitor.github.io/random_choice_picker/

This project is from the Day 13 code along video from Udemy's 50 projects in 50 days series focused on web development. I have heavily commented the CSS and JavaScript to make notes to myself why certain choices are being made and what each line of code does.

### Overall Impression

Nifty app for random selection with visual appeal. This project helped cement my understanding of setTimeout() and setInterval() and is a great example of how to apply those methods.

### Things Learned

* .focus() method to put cursor focus on element
* .trim() method removes spaces
